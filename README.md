# 👋 Welcome to the CS 5328 Shared Repository

This repository is used for managing **team-based sprint submissions** throughout the semester.

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each team has a dedicated folder under `/teams/`. Please work only within your assigned team folder:

```
/teams/
  ├── Team1/
  ├── Team2/
  ├── Team3/
  └── Team4/
```

## ✅ Submitting Your Work
- All work for **each sprint** should be committed inside your team folder.
- Create a **new branch** for each sprint (e.g., `sprint1`, `sprint2`, etc.).
- When ready, open a **Pull Request** from your sprint branch to your team’s main branch.
- Include in your pull request:
  - A summary of completed features
  - Screenshots of working components (frontend/backend)
  - A section in `README.md` with sprint-specific documentation

## 🚨 Important Reminders
- Do **not** make changes outside your team's folder.
- Keep your branches clean and follow commit message guidelines.
- Use the issues tab or discussions for questions or blockers.
